# Roundabout

## Description

Roundabout is an interactive simulation project that allows you to explore a virtual roundabout with various assets and elements, including vehicles, traffic lights, buildings, and more. This project provides a visual representation of a roundabout's dynamics and allows you to interact with it in real time.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install the following dependencies to run Roundabout:

- Flask==2.3.3
- Mesa==2.1.1
- pathfinding==1.0.4
- pygame==2.5.1
- PyOpenGL==3.1.7
- PyOpenGL-accelerate==3.1.7

Note: you need the last version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) to run this proyect

## Getting Started

To get started with Roundabout, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/jossjic/roundabout
```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Go to the "back" directory on your Command Line and run backend.py

   ```bash
   cd back; python .\backend.py
   ```

4. Open a new Command Line, go to the "front" directory and run planoRounda.py
   ```bash
   cd front; python .\planoRounda.py
   ```
5. Wait for the loading and enjoy the simulation

Note: You can omit steps 3 to 5 if you run the file >run.py from the main directory.

## Usage

- Explore the virtual roundabout and observe its dynamics.
- Interact with the simulation, click + drag to move the camera

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to the open-source community for the development and maintenance of essential libraries and tools used in this project.

Enjoy exploring the Roundabout!
